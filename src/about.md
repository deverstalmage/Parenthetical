![Me](images/me.jpg "Me") Hi. My name's Devers, and this is my blog devoted to web development, software engineering, and maybe a handful of other topics I feel compelled to write about.

I work as the senior web developer at [Represent.Us](https://represent.us/), a non-profit in [Northampton, MA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Northampton,+MA/@42.3295905,-72.6633999,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e6d73e7c8e2a05:0xc316750b13d8db0b) helping to build the movement to end corruption in the US government.

You can check out my [github](https://github.com/deverstalmage/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/devers),  [instagram](http://instagram.com/devers) or [whatever](https://soundcloud.com/devers).
